# 📊 Trader Behavior & Market Sentiment Analysis

Analyzing the relationship between trader performance and Bitcoin's Fear & Greed Index using Hyperliquid trading data.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Explore how market sentiment influences trader behavior and profitability.
- **Data Sources**:
  1. **Trader Data**: Historical trade records (account, symbol, execution price, side, pnl, timestamp, etc.)
  2. **Sentiment Data**: Bitcoin Fear/Greed Index (date + sentiment classification)

🔄 Data Processing Pipeline
Preprocessing

Parses timestamps Timestamp IST (day-first format)

Aligns trader and sentiment datasets on date

Daily Aggregation & Feature Engineering

Computes mean PnL, trade count, long/short ratio

Generates rolling features and lags

Clustering

Uses K-Means on mean PnL and long-ratio to identify recurring behavioral regimes

Classification

Random Forest predicts Fear vs Greed using trader metrics

Evaluated via accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and feature importance

EDA & Statistical Analysis

Time-series plots, distribution comparisons (KDE), volatility analysis, t-tests

Rolling correlations and hourly sentiment activity profiles

📊 Key Insights (Provisional)
Behavioral clusters appear aligned with sentiment regimes

Model demonstrates above-random ability (AUC > 0.5)

Mean PnL and trade-side ratio emerge as top predictors

Volatility displays clustering; PnL distributions differ significantly between Fear/Greed days

Trading volume varies intraday across sentiment cycles

🛠️ Future Extensions
Integrate rolling features into classification to boost accuracy

Optimize classifiers using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

Expand feature set with on-chain metrics (e.g. gas, whale transfers)

Develop intraday models for fine-grained timing strategies
